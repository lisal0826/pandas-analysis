Comparison by School Type:

Charter schools outperform district schools in both math and reading, with higher average scores and passing percentages. For instance, Charter schools have an average math score of approximately 80.43, compared to 77.74 for district schools. Similarly, the average reading score for Charter schools is approximately 82.53, while for district schools, it's about 81.34. These differences suggest that the type of school impacts academic performance.
Effect of School Size on Performance:

School size also appears to influence academic performance. Small-sized schools, defined as those with less than 1000 students, tend to have higher average math and reading scores, as well as higher passing rates compared to medium and large-sized schools. For example, the average math score for small-sized schools is about 83.82, whereas for medium and large-sized schools, it's approximately 83.37 and 77.75, respectively. This trend suggests that smaller schools may provide a more conducive environment for academic achievement.
